WP Healthcheck is a plugin to check the health of your WordPress install.

== Description ==

[WP Healthcheck](https://wp-healthcheck.com) is a plugin to check the health of your WordPress install.

It detects some useful information regarding your site health, like the number of active transients and autoload options, and then displays them conveniently via the WordPress Dashboard.

This plugin can help you improve your site performance by cleaning up the transients and deactivating autoload options.

WP Healthcheck also verifies the software versions in use by your server. We maintain information about software minimum requirements up to date in our systems. This allows the plugin to retrieve this information from our external API and compare versus the ones installed in your server.

SSL certificate expiration dates are also checked and notifications for expired or near expiration SSL certificates are provided conveniently via the WordPress Dashboard.

= WP-CLI Extension =

WP Healthcheck also includes a WP-CLI extension. If you want to see all the CLI commands available in the plugin, go ahead and run `wp healthcheck` in your site.

* <code>wp healthcheck autoload [--deactivate=<option-name>] [--history]</code>
* <code>wp healthcheck transient [--delete-expired] [--delete-all]</code>
* <code>wp healthcheck server</code>
* <code>wp healthcheck ssl</code>
