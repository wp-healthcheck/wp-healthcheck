WP Healthcheck is a plugin to check the health of your WordPress install.

== Description ==

[WP Healthcheck](https://wp-healthcheck.com) is a plugin to check the health of your WordPress install.

It detects some useful information regarding your site health, like the number of active transients and autoload options, and then bring them up to you via Dashboard.

After that, it can help you to improve your site performance by cleaning up the transients and deactivating autoload options.

Also, WP Healthcheck verifies for the version of the softwares installed in your server. To perform this verification, the plugin retrieves data from our external API and then compare the versions available in our API versus the ones installed in your server.

= WP-CLI Extension =

This plugin also includes a WP-CLI extension. If you want to see all the commands available in the plugin, go ahead and run `wp healthcheck` in your site.

* <code>wp healthcheck autoload [--deactivate=<option-name>] [--history]</code>
* <code>wp healthcheck transient [--delete-expired] [--delete-all]</code>
* <code>wp healthcheck server</code>
